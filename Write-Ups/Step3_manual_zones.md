# Custom Polygon Zones Digitized Manually

Since detailed barrio boundaries were unavailable, zones were digitized manually using a high-quality reference image.

### Tools Used
- QGIS "Add Polygon" tool
- Scanned map reference overlaid beneath raster

### Steps
1. Loaded reference image
2. Set transparency on NDVI raster
3. Created new layer and digitized each zone manually
